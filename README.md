# Family Tree v2

View your family tree in perfect symmetry and clarity. All nodes are automatically self centered and can have infine descendants.

Modifications made to the Reingold-Tilford Algorithm to increase self-centering speed, proper sibling spacing and pairs.

Remaining Tasks

- Use global css properties for node scaling (node heights, widths, spacingX, spacingY)
- Add nodes and delete nodes through the GUI
- Ability to save and share tree
- Better CSS and Styling
- Hosted Web UI
- Ability to click on any node and see the family tree from their perspective
  - Like if you wanted to see a spouse's family tree

Current issues:

- How to make width and heights dynamically adjustable?
- Using descendant paths from both spouses' center isn't dynamic for when the spouses are dragged (their center stays put) and isn't dynamic to node scale
