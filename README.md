# Family Tree v2

View your family tree in perfect symmetry and clarity. All nodes are automatically self centered and can have infine descendants.

Modifications made to the Reingold-Tilford Algorithm to increase self-centering speed, proper sibling spacing and pairs.

Remaining Tasks

- FIX small bug where setting an editablefield also saves the other editablefields
  - editable fields aren't saved when other fields like the spouse and descendant are modified
- node styling, image styling
